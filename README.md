# Movie Recommender System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes a movie dataset from Kaggle, performs data cleaning and feature engineering, and applies Count Vectorizer and cosine similarity to recommend similar movies based on user selection. The system is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
